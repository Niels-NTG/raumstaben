# Little Bits

Series of sketches designed for LittleBits (https://www.littlebits.com/) and Arduino (https://www.arduino.cc/) hardware platform.

LittleBits are a series of electronic building blocks that magnetically snap together. The blue bits are for power, the magenta for both digital input (buttons, gates, toggles, etc.) and analog sensors (dimmers, sliders, light sensors, sound, tempature, etc.) and green ones show output. The orange bits are for wiring and extending your creations, of which W6 Arduino Bit is a microcontroller. This is a tiny computer that can receive and control connected electronics using logic you can code yourself. It also allows for communication between the Bits and a computer.

Each sketch includes the Arduino program that has to be uploaded to the microcontroller. This requires the Arduino IDE. For more information on how to get started programming on the Arduino platform, visit https://www.arduino.cc/.

Sketches 1, 2 and 3 are programmed for a hardware setup that is equal or similar to the one pictured below:

The i5 slide dimmer bits can be replaced with a light sensor, pressure sensor, tempature sensor, microphone or any other analog sensor. The 7-segment display bits and single LED bit can be used for demonstrating the sensor readings on the hardware itself, but are not required for working with the sketches.
